        <h6 class="col s12">Sam has just gotten the latest Bio test scores from Jag, and all he has to say is Y I K E S. He wants to talk to all of the Bio students about what happened during the exam, but he wants to prioritize his problems and talk to the students with the lowest scores first. However, the scores that he got from Jag were slightly out of order, and Sam doesn't want to waste his time going through all of them to fix a small error. </h6>
        <h6 class="col s12">Help Sam find the smallest possible subset of scores in the list that he needs to sort in order to get all the scores in perfectly sorted order.</h6>
        <h6 class="col s12">INPUT:<br>
        The first line of the input contains a single integer N, denoting the length of the list of student IDs. Line 2 contains a space-separated list of student IDs with length N.
