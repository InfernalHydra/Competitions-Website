        <h6 class="col s12">Russ has decided to update his records. He wants to move to a computerized system that keeps track of each student, and how many times they've gotten docc'd at TAMS. However, since TAMS has no funding, his previous system is old, and on paper, and only records the student ID of each doc, which means there may be repeats.</h6>
        <h6 class="col s12">Help Russ develop a system that sorts each student in decreasing order by the number of times they've been docc'd by TAMS admin/staff. Russ, being extremely reluctant to computerize (he was used to using paper records for the past thousand years), decides that if two students have gotten docc'd the same amount of times, they will be kept in the same order as they were in paper.</h6>
        <h6 class="col s12">INPUT:<br>
The first line of the input contains a single integer N, denoting the length of the list of student IDs. Line 2 contains a space-separated list of student IDs with length N.
